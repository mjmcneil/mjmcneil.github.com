		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>Let me introduce myself, I'm a student at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I'm studying Systems Design Engineering where I like to focus on how we as a society interact with technology linked with user experience. 
		<br>
		Outside of the classroom I'm involved with engineering student life. I am currently one of the Vice Presidents Education for the Engineering Society 'B' and I'm a three time orientation Aerial Photo director.
		<br>
		As a Co-op student I have the opportunity to experience many different industries including financial, non-profit, telecommunications, and product development. It is through these jobs where I have developed my skills as well as learned many more.
		<br>
		I would love to get in touch with you via email or linkedin</a>.</p>

		<h2>ENAC</h2>
			<p>In the fall of 2012 I had the opportunity to go work in Toulouse, France at Ecole Nationale de l&#39;Aviation Civile as a research intern. While I was there I work on a project to remodel a prototype interface for their open source software platform <a href=" http://paparazzi.enac.fr/wiki/Main_Page">Paparazzi </a> used to control unmanned aerial vehicles. I analyzed the current user functions and structure of Paparazzi including going out into the field to observe user interactions. From these observations I designed the user interactions and the user interface for a prototype system my lab was developing. For the prototype system I created all of the SVG graphics and then implemented these components with the IStar and Paparazzi framework.</p>

		<h2>Teledyne Dalsa</h2>
		<p>In the winter of 2012 I worked at Teledyne Dalsa in Waterloo, a company that specializes in digital imaging and semiconductors. While at Dalsa I worked as a web developer under corporate communications. There I built upon their database functionality including transitioning static language content to be dynamically sourced from database content or global resource files and developing content authoring tools to add, edit, and publish website content. I also transferred an in-house frame rate calculation Excel algorithm into a responsive web page controlled by VB code behind dynamic look up tables. </p>
		<p>While working at Dalsa, I had the opportunity to work at the Kitchener-Waterloo United Way one day a week to help them out with their technical operations in the office. Over the course of the work term I was able to develop a project-team matching system for them to accommodate their local annual event &#34;The Day of Caring&#34;. The system I created allowed perspective projects and volunteer team to sign up online and then matched up based on group size or interest area by a United Way Employee. The final piece of the system allowed synchronized group emails out to projects and volunteer teams simultaneously. Overall this system saved lots of paper work and confusion by having one central system. </p>

		<h2>IFDS</h2>
			<p>In the summer of 2011 I worked downtown Toronto at the backend financial company Internation Financial Data Services (IFDS). I was a part of the research and development teams who&#39;s role was to introduce new innovative technologies into the office work space. While at IFDS I worked on numerous projects including a Work Queue Assignment System and the Xbox 360 Kinect sensor. Initially I used the Xbox Kinect to register user movements utilising C# with open source software packages OpenNI and PrimeSense-NITE to control the Work Queue Assignment. After I created a functioning backend structure to interface with existing company software using SQL and PHP, I transitioned the Work Queue Assignment system from a Kinect application to a more practical iPad web application. My last project at IFDS was to created user gesture with the Kinect which would cause less user fatigue to control existing company software. </p>

		<h2>Engsoc</h2>
			<p>I am one of the current elected executives of the Waterloo Engineering Society &#39;B&#39;. As Vice-President Education I represent all engineering students for all matters that are academic in nature.  As such I attend many academic meeting with faculty on subjects ranging from curriculum, academic policies, cooperative education, and professional development. </p>

		<h2>Aerial Photo</h2>
			<p>For the past three years I have been an Aerial Photo director for Waterloo Engineering Orientation. This directorship in compasses all aspects of the event including event preparation, design of the photo, booking the venue and photographer and layout of inflow and outflow of leaders/students. I really enjoy this event because after all of the hard work and planning you have a physical reminder that will last for years to come. </p>

		<h2>Travel</h2>
			<p>As my latest coop term was centered in the south of France, I was able to take advantage of my location and inexpensive transportation to travel around Europe on the weekends. I was able to go many locations in the south of France including: Carcasonne, Albi, Biaritz, Pyla, Bordeaux, St. Emilion and Foix. Near the end of the term I also was able to travel to Barcelona in Spain, London in the U.K., Brussels in Belgium and Paris. I had a spectacular time travelling around and I can&#39;t wait to discover more of the world!</p>
